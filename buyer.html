        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>An aggregated marketplace with over 1+ million unique SKUs from 1k+ different distributors has buyers, establishments with valid liquor licenses, that search the marketplace for products and create orders to send to their distributor partners. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Out of all the active monthly buyers on the aggregated marketplace less than 10% of them were using the ordering tool. My goal was to understand the user's friction and make design suggestions to improve the ordering experience.

      <div class="cs-body">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>A redesigned cart to help buyers more easily navigate, update, and send orders to distributor partners.

        <h3>Discovery & User Research</h3>
        <p>The research consisted of collecting and analyzing past research. I looked for gaps in our understanding of the problem.  Conducted stakeholder interviews, surveyed 133 buyers, interviewed 8+ current customers, and researched the competitive landscape.
        </p>
        <h5>User Journey</h5> 
        <p>
        The most interesting finding came in analyzing a buyer's journey to placing an order. Where were they dropping off? Where were they getting confused? The key takeaways here led to re-organizing the flow of information and providing helpful reminders throughout their journey to order.
