      <div class="cs-body">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>A health and wellness company that developed lifestyle plans based on a person's genome, blood markers, stress hormones, and gut microbiome had a very expensive price point of $3,000 with a commitment of one year. The company was looking for different strategies to help nurture individuals into the 1 years flagship program. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="cs-body">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>A ‚Äúlight‚Äù version of the company's program with a limited amount of genetic data and one coaching session at the price point of $50.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="cs-body">
        <h3>The Team</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A coaching &amp; scientific team </li>
          <li>2 project managers</li>
          <li>3 dev</li>

        <h3>Discovery & User Research</h3>
        <p>While the company's main program consisted of blood testing, which required the customer to schedule with a clinical laboratory for an intravenous blood draw, this new product used saliva and could be collected at home. This change dramatically simplified the user's journey.
        </p>
        <h5>User Journey</h5> 
        <p>
        The saliva kits would be delivered to the customer, the customer would then set up their online dashboard, they would send the kit back, wait for results, get an email when the results were processed, and finally schedule a call with a coach.
        </p>   
      </div> <!-- end of UR -->

      <div class="cs-body">
        <h3>Designing & Ideation</h3>
        <p>After mapping out the user journey, it was clear this new program had a lot of <em>unknown time periods</em> between each important stage. We had no idea how long it would take for people to send kits back and only a rough estimate for DNA processing.
        </p>
        <h5>Designing for Different States</h5> 
        <p>
        The dashboard required 3 important state changes‚Äî before genetic data, after genetic data was processed, and after the coaching call. The most important state would be the empty state before a person received their data and to make the dashboard come to life when data was ingested.
